# Raspberry Pi Web Alerts

Turn your Raspberry Pi into an AI-powered security camera via HTTPS, TensorFlow and WebRTC.

# How it works


- The code inside `/device` goes inside the Raspberry Pi as a system service.
- The rest of the code is deployed at https://rpi-web-alerts.fly.dev.
- Client, server and device work together to bring real-time video and alerts
